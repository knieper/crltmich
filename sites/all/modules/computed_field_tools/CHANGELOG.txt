Computed Field Tools 6.x-1.1
============================

Features
- While batch processing it now displays an estimated time left and remaining items rather than processed items.

Bugfixes:
- #1494178 by frakke: Now not storing unchanged data thus avoiding warnings and gaining some performance.
- by frakke: Removed dependency on views.
- by frakke: When the content of a computed field is changed, the content cache for the node is cleared which makes the new content available immediately.
